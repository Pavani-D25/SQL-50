ðŸ“„ LeetCode 584: Find Customer Referee
ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

We are given a Customer table with the following columns:

Column Name	Type	Description
id	int	Unique identifier for each customer
name	str	Name of the customer
referee_id	int	ID of the customer who referred this customer, or NULL if none

We need to **find the names of customers who are not referred by customer with id = 2.

ðŸ”¹ Example Input
Customer Table
id	name	referee_id
1	Will	NULL
2	Jane	NULL
3	Alex	2
4	Bill	NULL
5	Zack	1
6	Mark	2
ðŸ”¹ Expected Output
name
Will
Jane
Bill
Zack

âœ… Explanation:

Alex and Mark are excluded because their referee_id = 2.

All other customers are included.

ðŸ”¹ SQL Query
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id <> 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;

ðŸ”¹ Explanation of Query

FROM Customer â†’ Select from the Customer table.

WHERE referee_id <> 2 â†’ Keeps only customers whose referee is not customer 2.

OR referee_id IS NULL â†’ Also keeps customers who donâ€™t have any referee.

SELECT name â†’ Return only the customer names that meet the condition.

This ensures we exclude only customers referred by id = 2.
