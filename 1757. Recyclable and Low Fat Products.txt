ðŸ“„ LeetCode 1757: Recyclable and Low Fat Products
ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

We are given a Products table with the following columns:

Column Name	Type	Description
product_id	int	Unique identifier for each product
low_fats	enum	'Y' if the product is low fat, 'N' otherwise
recyclable	enum	'Y' if the product is recyclable, 'N' otherwise

We need to find the IDs of products that are both recyclable and low fat.

ðŸ”¹ Example Input
Products Table
product_id	low_fats	recyclable
0	Y	N
1	Y	Y
2	N	Y
3	Y	Y
4	N	N
ðŸ”¹ Expected Output
product_id
1
3

âœ… Explanation: Only product 1 and product 3 have both low_fats = 'Y' and recyclable = 'Y'.

ðŸ”¹ SQL Query
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' 
  AND recyclable = 'Y';

ðŸ”¹ Explanation of Query

FROM Products â†’ Select from the Products table.

WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y' â†’ Filters rows where both conditions are true.

SELECT product_id â†’ Output only the product IDs of those rows.

This query ensures only products that meet both criteria are included in the result.
