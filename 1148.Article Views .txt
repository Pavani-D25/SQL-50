ðŸ”¹ Expected Output

âœ… Explanation:

Author 7 viewed their own article (row 2).

Author 4 viewed their own article (row 6).

Author 3 never viewed their own article.

ðŸ”¹ SQL Query
SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY id;

ðŸ”¹ Explanation of Query

FROM Views â†’ Work on the Views table.

WHERE author_id = viewer_id â†’ Keep only rows where the author viewed their own article.

SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id â†’ Output unique author IDs as id.

ORDER BY id â†’ Sort ascending as required.

This ensures we only get authors who are also viewers of their own work.
