📄 LeetCode 595: Big Countries
🔹 Problem Statement

We are given a World table with the following columns:

Column Name	Type	Description
name	str	The name of the country
continent	str	The continent the country belongs to
area	int	The area of the country (in square km)
population	int	The population of the country
gdp	bigint	The GDP value of the country

We need to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.
A country is considered big if:

area >= 3,000,000, or

population >= 25,000,000

🔹 Example Input
World Table
name	continent	area	population	gdp
Afghanistan	Asia	652230	25500100	20343000000
Albania	Europe	28748	2831741	12960000000
Algeria	Africa	2381741	37100000	188681000000
Andorra	Europe	468	78115	3712000000
Angola	Africa	1246700	20609294	100990000000
🔹 Expected Output
name	population	area
Afghanistan	25500100	652230
Algeria	37100000	2381741

✅ Explanation:

Afghanistan qualifies because population ≥ 25,000,000.

Algeria qualifies because population ≥ 25,000,000 (even though its area is less than 3M).

Others are excluded.

🔹 SQL Query
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 
   OR population >= 25000000;

🔹 Explanation of Query

FROM World → Select from the World table.

WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000 → Keep only countries that are considered “big.”

SELECT name, population, area → Output the required columns.

This ensures the result contains only big countries with the requested fields.
